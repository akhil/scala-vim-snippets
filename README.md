Scala Vim Snippets
==================

I just took the Scala snippets from TextMate and put them in a snipMate
.snippets file.

Installation
------------
If you are in UNIX-land, you should be able to use `make install` to install
them.

If you are on Windows, copy the snippets file into your \_vim\snippets folder.
You'll know where this is better than I do.

`make extract` moves your scala.snippets file from your ~/.vim/snippets back to
the working directory so you can check them in.

The Makefile really might be the simplest thing you've ever seen.

Syntax Checking
---------------
It's quite possible when you are copying and pasting snippets files together to
bugger up the syntax. check.rb is a Ruby script that checks each line of the
script using the regex provided by the syntax file for snipMate snippets files.
`make check` will syntax check the file for you.

smDoc
-----
smDoc creates HTML and PDF documentation from snipMate files. HTML generation
is done using the smdoc.rb tool - invoked using `make doc-html`.

The HTML documentation generation uses a simple JavaDoc-style syntax - for each
snippet entry, you can prefix it with a line that starts "## ". In there, put
as much description as you want to. You can use inline HTML if you like, but
try to keep the descriptions short and snappy. It renders these into a
definition list (the dl,dt,dd tags).

As well as this, you need to produce a small file called metadata.yml which
contains the name of the programming language or tool you have written the
snippets file for, the name of the primary author and a contact e-mail
address. 

PDF generation is currently for OS X only. It uses a RubyGem called wkpdf which
uses the WebKit rendering engine on the Mac to render a PDF. This can be
invoked using `make doc-pdf-a4` and `make doc-pdf-letter`. 

Blather
-------
Key snippets:
  - class
  - cclass (case class)
  - trait
  - object
  - application
  - def
  - if, ifelse
  - try
  - tfc (try, catch, finally)
	- bizarre name, I know, but it's how it is in the TM bundle. If other
	  people find this particularly annoying, I'll fix it
  - match, case
  - p (println)
  - main
