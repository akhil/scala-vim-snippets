Scala Vim Snippets

I just took the Scala snippets from TextMate and put them in a snipMate
.snippets file.

INSTALLATION
If you are in UNIX-land, you should be able to use `make install` to install
them.

If you are on Windows, copy the snippets file into your _vim\snippets folder.
You'll know where this is better than I do.

`make extract` moves your scala.snippets file from your ~/.vim/snippets back to
the working directory so you can check them in.

The Makefile really might be the simplest thing you've ever seen.

SYNTAX CHECKING
It's quite possible when you are copying and pasting snippets files together to
bugger up the syntax. check.rb is a Ruby script that checks each line of the
script using the regex provided by the syntax file for snipMate snippets files.
`make check` will syntax check the file for you.

BLATHER
Key snippets:
  - class
  - cclass (case class)
  - trait
  - object
  - application
  - def
  - if, ifelse
  - try
  - tfc (try, catch, finally)
	- bizarre name, I know, but it's how it is in the TM bundle. If other
	  people find this particularly annoying, I'll fix it
  - match, case
  - p (println)
  - main
