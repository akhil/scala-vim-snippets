Scala Vim Snippets

I just took the Scala snippets from TextMate and put them in a snipMate
.snippets file.

INSTALLATION
If you are in UNIX-land, you should be able to use `make install` to install
them.

If you are on Windows, copy the snippets file into your _vim\snippets folder.
You'll know where this is better than I do.

`make extract` moves your scala.snippets file from your ~/.vim/snippets back to
the working directory so you can check them in.

The Makefile really might be the simplest thing you've ever seen.

BLATHER
Key snippets:
  - class
  - cclass (case class)
  - trait
  - object
  - application
  - def
  - if, ifelse
  - try
  - tfc (try, catch, finally)
	- bizarre name, I know, but it's how it is in the TM bundle. If other
	  people find this particularly annoying, I'll fix it
  - match, case
  - p (println)
  - main
